# Podcast-Finder

This app uses the Listen API to search for and play podcasts within the website. Searches can be organized by relevance or date
(most-recent first). The website also utilizes pagination for organized viewing of the data. The back-end for this website was
built using Node.js and Bootstrap was used to style the front-end.
